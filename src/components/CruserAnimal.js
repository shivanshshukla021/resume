        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> Animal healthcare is a setting for animals that
        enables us to offer them all the amenities in one location. From the
        time of an animal's birth until the time of its death, we offer all the
        necessary assistance in this service-providing environment. This
        includes providing any animal with all necessary medical treatment as
        well as mentoring and physical, mental, and emotional support. For
        active use, professionals including doctors, dieticians, trainers, and
        NGO's are accessible. This will give people a fantastic opportunity to
        take care of their pets.

        <h3>MOTIVATION </h3>Consider the lives of street animals who have no one
        to care for them. Our great ambition is to provide any form of
        assistance to all animals. In today's world, a person with a pet does
        his or her hardest to provide all the facilities to his or her pet, but
        sometimes fails.

        <h3>LITERATURE REVIEW</h3>
        Many programmes in the field of animal healthcare are aimed at enhancing
        the welfare and health of domesticated animals, wild animals, and
        cattle. A survey of the literature on projects aimed at improving the
        health of animals finds a variety of methods, including vaccination
        campaigns, disease surveillance and control, veterinarian care and
        training, and public education and awareness campaigns. In one study,
        conducted by Dohoo et al. in 2017, the effect of an Indian national
        animal disease control programme on the incidence of brucellosis and
        bovine tuberculosis was assessed. The programme, the authors discovered,
        had a sizable effect on lowering the prevalence of these diseases,
        underlining the significance of disease management initiatives in
        enhancing animal health. Another Study by Bhanderi et al. (2015) looked
        at the influence of vaccination programmes on the frequency of
        foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Gujarat, India, in another research. The
        effectiveness of the immunisation campaign in lowering FMD cases,
        according to the authors, highlights the value of vaccination as a
        disease prevention measure. Many initiatives have centred on enhancing
        veterinarian care and training in addition to disease management
        strategies. A research conducted by Kumar et al. (2018) assessed the
        effectiveness of a veterinary outreach programme in rural India that
        sought to enhance the expertise of nearby veterinarians. The program's
        remarkable increases in veterinary knowledge and abilities, according to
        the authors, underline the need of continued training and assistance for
        veterinary practitioners. Lastly, public education and awareness
        campaigns have been a major emphasis of many animal healthcare
        initiatives. An evaluation of the effects of an animal care education
        programme in Chennai, India, schools was done by Ramachandran et al.
        (2018). The programme, according to the authors' research, significantly
        raised students' knowledge and awareness of problems relating to animal
        care. This proves the value of early education and awareness campaigns
        in promoting animal welfare. Overall, the literature review emphasises
        the value of an integrated strategy for animal healthcare, with an
        emphasis on illness prevention, veterinarian treatment, and training, as
        well as public awareness and education campaigns.

        <h3>My Contribution</h3>
        Shivansh is the GROUP LEADER and responsible for making this project
        successfully complete. I have checked that the work is being carried out
        with diligence and with an acceptable level of perfection. Shivansh
        proposed the idea of the project by analyzing the problems faced by the
        animals in their daily life. It was an idea that can change the animal
        and human world and using all facilities already being provided by
        government animals are still not getting any benefits out of that and
        creating a bridge between these animals and facilities is the whole idea
        about. Shivansh Contacted NGOS , Doctors and studies more about the
        problem Shivansh had a detailed conversation with the NGOS & Doctor
        regarding the implementation of project ideas and all important things
        needed to execute the project properly. Shivansh has Worked on Backend
        using NODE JS and EXPRESS JS.Made all routes for web pages using the
        NODE JS environment using the express framework. NODE JS -Node.js is a
        very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome's
        JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web
        applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and
        other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and
        used by thousands of developers around the world. EXPRESS JS- Express is
        a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a
        robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Shivansh had a
        discussion with Government Officials for setting up HealthCare Center
        Furthermore Shivansh also contacted the government officers of the State
        of .The government officials informed about various schemes and funds
        allotted by the government. The state government also informed that the
        funds are allotted by the central government to each and every state for
        animal and pet care. The government assured support once the project is
        complete. Having an offline model for animals is most important and in
        this way we can accomplish our target and hence having an offline center
        is what I was very concerned about. Shivansh was also involved in report
        making and content writing . In conclusion, Shivansh was totally
        responsible for making this project and dividing the work among the
        members and having a check on all works and being a leader I took all
        the responsibility of talking to authorities who can help us in making
        this project a real time problem solver. I was always connected with
        doctors and NGOS while working on this project and being a simple
        service using API i was also involved in backend things using NODE JS
        environment and EXPRESS JS framework
